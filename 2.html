    <h2>deep learning</h2>
    <p>Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family
    of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation
    learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.[1][2][3]</p>

    <p style= margin-top:20px;>Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks,
     graph neural networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks
     have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition,
    natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design,
    medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs,
    where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert
     performance.[4][5][6][7]</p>
     <p>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed
    communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological
    brains. Specifically, neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological
     brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue.[8][9][10]</p>
