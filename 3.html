    <h2>neural network</h2>
    <p>A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense,
       an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.[1] </p>

    <p style= margin-top:20px;>Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of biological neurons,
       or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron
       are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections.
       All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function
       controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1.</p>
