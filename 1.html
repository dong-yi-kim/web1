      target ="blank" title = "Machine learning spec">Machine learning(ML)</a> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
    and by the use of data.[1]
    It is seen as a part of <strong><u>artificial</u> intelligence.</strong>
    Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data",
    in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
    [2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition,
    and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[3]</p>

    <p style= margin-top:20px;>A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics,
    which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning.
    The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods,theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
    Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[5][6] In its application across business problems,
    machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.</p>
